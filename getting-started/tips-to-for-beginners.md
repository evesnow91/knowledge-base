# Tips for Beginners

### 1. Check the URL to make sure it says ‘Zillet.io’.

- Keep us bookmarked for future use.
- Phishers are tricky, so make sure there are no dots or accents on any of the letters.
- If you find a phishing site, send it to us so we can take it down!
- Download EAL, PhishFort, or Cryptonite for up-to-date alerts when visiting known phishing sites.

### 2. Use the checksummed version of your address.

- This is the version of your address that includes "zil" as its prefix.
- For more information on checksummed addresses, click [here](https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa/wiki/Address-Standard).


### 3. Send a small amount first, to test the waters.

- We cannot reverse, cancel, or refund transactions. Make sure you know the process inside and out!
- Learn more about sending transactions [here](/how-to-send-a-transaction).

### 4. Keep your information off the computer.

- Write down everything in physical backups.
- Pen and paper is highly underrated. No one can hack your notebook!
- However, you can lose your notebook – so make extra copies.

### 5. Do not share your private information with anyone.

- Including us! We will never ask for your private key.
- We will never email you first. If you got an email from us without emailing us first, it’s not us.

### 6. Google can be your best friend or your worst enemy

- Do your research, and remain skeptical!
- Before sending to a third-party or using a new service, Google the service name + ‘scam’ or ‘reviews’.

### 7. Pay very close attention to address entry and Ask for help.

- Sending to a wrong address can mean the permanent loss of your funds. Make sure you know who you’re sending to.
- Double and triple check everything. Even one wrong character will make a difference and lead to loss of funds.
- Never hand type anything. Copy & paste is your best friend!
- This is still a very new field, but it has a strong community to back it up.
